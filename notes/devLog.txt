    $ cd wipninja
    $ npm install
    $ npm install vue-router vuex firebase –save	//dash dash
    $ git init

    $ npm run dev
  5/1 19:30 – welcome to your vue.js app is up
    Hand-code the signon/signoff/navbar/etc.      // could just copy/paste from toolbox
  5/1 19:50 – add firebase auth for wipninja
  5/1 20:10 – working; committed

Next, add board component, category component, task component; store these objects; then, assemble them.  Take 10 minutes to PLAN before coding…
  5/2 18:30
    Add Board.vue rough-in; hook it to navbar.
  5/2 19:00 - 19:30
    Read up on firebase database.  Looks pretty damn slick; going to plug it in.
  5/4 19:30 - 21:30
    Add Task and AddTask components.  Storing tasks to firebase db now.
    Display tasks as separate cards.

Next, add task timestamp, then history
  5/5 18:30 - add firebase timestamp
  5/5 18:40 - 19:30 read the firebase db docs
  5/6 13:00 - oof.  hitting a wall on how to capture updated input boxes in a component.  simple w/ just jqery.
              capturing the key now; started to build a version/history for each element in the document.
              ... going to reverse that course and use a block-chain for each task. inserts only.  the tasks are small.
              ... made the block-chain work.  second/third guessing it now.  maybe history is smarter.
                  like this...
                  task : {
                    description: [
                      { v:'1', ts:234234232, value: 'foo' },
                      { v:'2', ts:234234444, value: 'bar' }
                    ],
                    status: [
                      { v:'1', ts:234234232, value: 'backlog' },
                      { v:'2', ts:234234444, value: 'wip'     },
                      { v:'3', ts:234234567, value: 'complete'}
                    ]
                  }
  5/8 19:30 - figure out how to persist on 1 edit per card instead of 1 edit per input per card, then plug in the versioning as described above
            - root cause is because I'm not updating this.key and this.task when a task is updated.
            - bad design though; I'm updating store when the render updated() event fires.  this can be dangerous/loopy.
              for now, go to an easier plan-b... add a 'save' button, so you can just do standard onclick, save.
              double back once prototype is up to allow for save without a save button, cuz that's dumb.  i have that working in plain ol js.
              ... that took one minute.  Jeezus! Stop getting bogged down in bullshit - it's a prototype.
      21:00 - now I'm ready to version the json.  but my brain is tired.  calling it a night.  ugh.

  5/9 19:00 - push to github, clean up a bit, then do the history
            - git commit -a -m "Add board, tasks, vuex store, firebase db"
            - git remote add origin https://github.com/ScottHensen/wipninja.git
            - git push -u origin master
